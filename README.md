# Data visualization on Tableau
###  This project involves creating a CSV file from SQL query and further displaying that CSV data in the Tableau public platform.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- The visualizations that are created can be found on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kinshuk.chadha).
- The script to be used to perform the query can be found [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhj4axkaupjhmbq/employees_mod.sql?dl=0)


## Stack used
1. MYSQL workbench
2. Windows
3. MS Excel to store query results
4. Tabluea Public for creating visulization


## Steps to execute the whole process
1. Download the SQL script provided on the link
2. Open MySQL workbench and load the database (make sure to have a connection open)
3. Execute the script that will create the **Employees-mod-db** database on the local machine
4. Open ++tableau-queries.sql++ file
5. Execute each query one by one while exporting the results in a CSV file.
6. Create an account on Tableau Public, import the CSV files, and create desired visualizations (must know how to operate Tableau for this)

## NOTE
I created 4 scripts that produce 4 CSV files that are displayed in tableau under the names Book1 to Book4 respectively.
Employee Dashboard is a dashboard having all 4 visualizations together.
